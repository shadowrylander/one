Assimilate Emacs packages as Git submodules
===========================================

One is a bare-bones package manager for Emacs packages.  It provides
only a few essential features and should be combined with other tools
such as [Magit], [`epkg`], [`use-package`], and [`auto-compile`].

One assimilates packages into the `~/.emacs.d` repository as Git
submodules.  An assimilated package is called a drone and a one-based
`~/.emacs.d` repository is called a collective.
