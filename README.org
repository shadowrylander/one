* Assimilate Emacs packages as Git submodules
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
One is a bare-bones package manager for Emacs packages. It provides only
a few essential features and should be combined with other tools such as
[[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]],
[[https://github.com/emacscollective/epkg][=epkg=]],
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][=use-package=]], and
[[https://github.com/tarsius/auto-compile][=auto-compile=]].

One assimilates packages into the =~/.emacs.d= repository as Git
submodules. An assimilated package is called a drone and a one-based
=~/.emacs.d= repository is called a collective.
